    <div class="aboutMe">
        Hello there! As stated above, my name is Samantha - but I prefer Sam. I am a Software Engineering student, and my inspiration for this field 
        comes from a love of problem-solving, technology, and the <strong>need</strong> to understand how everything works! I just started my learning journey not too long ago, and can't wait to contribute and make an impact
        to the constantly changing tech world. I've got some pretty grand personal goals, as well as career goals with my husband as his business partner. As a woman, I feel that it is as important as ever to have representation in the tech industry - I truly wish that I had a close mentor in my life to teach me all of the amazing languages and opportunites that come with knowing them all the while not feeling like an imposter in a male dominated industry.
        When I'm not learning about software engineering, I spend my time with my husband and our two amazing dogs. We recently moved back to my homestate Washington, from Texas.. Washington State is absolutely beautiful and has so many wonderful sights to see! That is also why I decided to take the leap <em>now</em> into furthering my education.. I left my job in sales/management behind and am not looking back!

        I will update my page as I get more projects under my belt, as of right now you're looking at my FIRST one! I know, I know.. practice makes perfect. I can't wait to see where I am at this time next year and what this site will look like in the future.

        Until next time, 
       
        Sam
